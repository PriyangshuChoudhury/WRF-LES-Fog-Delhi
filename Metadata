## 📌 Notes  
- Geopotential (PH + PHB) can be used to derive geometric heights.  
- Derived products (e.g., turbulence dissipation rate ε, liquid water content LWC, cloud droplet number Nd and Relative Humidity) require post-processing.  
- Temporal averaging: All variables are stored as time means over the simulation output interval.
